# DANCEFLOOR

Dancefloor Simulator!

---

Idea was to make box people behave as they would in real music club. This little game is only my own playing ground, I'm learning to make AI in game and use **behavior trees**.

## Using

- [luxe](https://github.com/underscorediscovery/luxe) - Haxe game engine, **component entity system**!
- [hxbt](https://github.com/whuop/hxbt) - Haxe Behavior Trees, good place to start.
